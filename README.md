# osrm-c

C-binding to the [Open Source Routing Machine - OSRM](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend).

## Why?

I wanted a fast Python binding for the library.
And I also think it's cool to have julia/rust/go bindings.

> It's the OSRM binding I deserves, but not the one I needs.

## Build

building osrm-c requires all dependencies required for building osrm, and scons.

1. build and install osrm
2. run scons
